Dificulties:
- As we have not used pojo's in our room implementation, it would have been a work overkill
if we would have integrated the Cantons and Counties within its correct hirachy on firebase.

- To show you that we've understood the management on the realtime db we have inserted all Cantons with its more than 2000 counties.
tough this Data on firebase is not being used, as the construct of the static db -> no entity, repo and viewmodel -not enough time left.

- Therefore we decided to concentrate on the real database so we know how to insert, update and delete data.

- Furthermore we've taken advantage of the Firebase Authentification, which was tricky to implement (to have the same ID's in the auth and the db)

Information - Branches:
master:
- Contains our state of work from the presentaion of part 1 Room
cloud:
- Contains our work for the firebae, clould implementaion
room:
- We have startd to make correction after the presentation of part 1, but as we had some interruption in our workflow, we had to switch to concentrate on the firebase - cloud implementation and therefore did not finnish our corrections
